description: An overview of the Sui GraphQL RPC service.

The ability to define precisely the data you want—and only the needed data—is a powerful advantage over traditional REST API endpoints. GraphQL lets you replace multiple REST requests with a single call to fetch the required data. The Sui GraphQL RPC service provides access to the data available on chain, and this topic describes a high level overview of the service, how to get started, where to find query examples, and the current limitations.

## Getting started

<!---  
### Top level queries
In GraphQL, you retrieve data through queries in a JSON format. At the top level, there are a number of [queries](./reference/queries/address) that you can execute.

### Pagination
Coming soon

### Mutations (executing transactions)
Coming soon

### Using the service
You can access the Sui GraphQL RPC service in multiple ways:
* an online interactive IDE is available for [mainnet](https://sui-mainnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql) and [testnet](https://sui-testnet.mystenlabs.com/graphql),
* if you use the Sui TypeScript SDK, read the [migration guide](./guides.mdx#migrating-guides) on how to use the updated TypeScript SDK that leverages the new GraphQL implementation,
* If you used to query the JSON RPC endpoints (e.g., via cURL or REST calls), you now have the option to query the new GraphQL endpoint in a similar fashion as before. 

For more details on how to query the service, please check out the [querying the service](./guides.mdx#querying-the-service) guidelines.

### Examples

Many examples can also be found in the [repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-graphql-rpc/examples). For example, in that folder you can find examples on [transaction block effects](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-graphql-rpc/examples/transaction_block_effects), [protocol configs](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-graphql-rpc/examples/protocol_configs), [stake connection](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-graphql-rpc/examples/stake_connection), and more. Each folder contains one or more examples that you can use in your queries (see [here](./guides.mdx#querying-the-service) for how to query).

Any existing addresses/object IDs in these examples refer to `mainnet` data only.

## Limits

The Sui GraphQL RPC service is rate-limited on all available instances to keep network throughput optimized and to protect against excessive or abusive calls to the service. 

### Rate limits
Queries are rate-limited at the number of attempts per minute to ensure high availability of the service to all users.

### Query limits

In addition to rate limits, queries are also validated against a number of rules on their complexity, such as the number of nodes, the depth of the query, or their payload size.
These limits can be retrieved by querying the `serviceConfig` field. An example of how to query for some of the available limits (at the time of this writing) follows:

```graphql
{
  serviceConfig {
    maxQueryDepth
    maxQueryNodes
    maxDbQueryCost
    requestTimeoutMs
    maxPageSize
    maxQueryPayloadSize
  }
}
```
